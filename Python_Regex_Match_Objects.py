# Python Regex
# re — Regular expression operations.
# This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl.
# Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (str) as well as 8-bit strings (bytes).
# However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode string with a byte pattern or vice-versa; similarly,
# when asking for a substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string.
# Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their
# special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal
# backslash, one might have to write '\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed
# as \\ inside a regular Python string literal.
#
# Match Objects:
# 
# Match objects always have a boolean value of True. Since match() and search() return None when there is no match, you can test whether there was a match
# with a simple if statement:
# 

match = re.search(pattern, string)

if match:
    process(match)
